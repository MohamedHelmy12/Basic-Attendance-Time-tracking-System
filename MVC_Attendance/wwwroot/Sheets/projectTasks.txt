Certainly, dividing the project so that each team member completes a feature end-to-end (from controller and view to testing) can ensure efficient collaboration. Let's break down the project features and assign them to each team member:

Team Structure:
Frontend Developer (F)
Backend Developer (B)
Database Administrator (D)
Quality Assurance Engineer (QA)
Feature Division:
User Management:

F: Design and implement user registration and profile management views using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
B: Implement corresponding controller actions for user registration and profile management, including validation.
QA: Test user registration, login, and profile management functionalities for usability and accuracy.
D: Ensure user-related data storage and retrieval in the database, including tables for users, roles, etc.
Student Management (CRUD Operations):

F: Design and implement views for managing students, including listing, adding, editing, and deleting students.
B: Develop controller actions for CRUD operations on student entities, integrating with the database.
QA: Test student management functionalities to ensure CRUD operations work correctly and handle errors gracefully.
D: Define and implement the database schema for student-related data, including tables for programs, intakes, tracks, etc.
Employee and Instructor Department Management (CRUD Operations):

F: Design and implement views for managing employees and instructor departments.
B: Implement controller actions for CRUD operations on employee and instructor department entities.
QA: Test employee and instructor department management functionalities for usability and correctness.
D: Set up the database schema for employee and instructor-related data, including tables for departments, supervisors, etc.
Attendance Recording and Tracking:

F: Design and implement views for recording daily attendance of students and viewing attendance reports.
B: Develop controller actions for recording attendance, managing permissions, and generating attendance reports.
QA: Test attendance recording and tracking functionalities to ensure accurate recording and reporting.
D: Design and implement the database schema for storing attendance records and permissions.
Phases:
Planning and Design: All team members collaborate to finalize requirements and design mockups for their respective features.

Implementation: Each team member works on their assigned feature, starting from frontend development, followed by backend implementation, database setup, and testing.

Integration and Testing: Once individual features are completed, integration testing is performed to ensure seamless interaction between different components.

Refinement and Deployment: After testing and refinement based on feedback, the application is prepared for deployment to a production environment.

By organizing the project in this manner, each team member can focus on completing a feature end-to-end, leading to efficient development and easier coordination.
